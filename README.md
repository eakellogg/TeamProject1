relational database management system

***************************
Big points:
-haven't tested with other teams DBMS yet
-formatting needs to be consistent throughout
-update prisoner crased when I tried to run it (I think possibly same problem as show cell block)
-show cell block doesn't work
-delete prisoner isn't done (but it's passable)
-show security level isn't implemented fully
***************************


-in update meal group (And other similar ones) should it say number instead of integer?
May be more clear to users that way
-Should we change the /n to endl ? Or does it really matter?
- Need to make the formatting and naming consistent, especially the formatting in all the if else statements.
My formatting was quite different from Jacob and Nathan's
- In my opinion, having a lot of lines with ************ makes it look cluttered
Do we need all of them in the commands Nathan/Jacob wrote? Maybe only keep a couple?
I'm okay with whatever on this, but we just need to be consistent and either remove theirs or add them to my code
- I assumed meal groups could be specified just by ID number, and they didn't.  So I probably need to go back and change all of my functions about meal groups to also ask for cell block.  (I think only one or two)
- Delete Prisoner - also want to add to it so that it will delete the corresponding sentences and sentence records
- Should there be an update sentence command? 
- Show Cell Block doesn't currently work
- need to figure out why after some requests it says **Enter command** **Not valid, try again** **Enter command**
(just try out a couple commands, you'll see what I mean)
- output for show sentence record is kinda messy because it outputs tables for several queries along the way
- double check naming convention throughout.  I got points off of my individual assignment b/c I wasn't consistent.
ie. namingConvention, namingconvention, NamingConvention, naming_convention....
